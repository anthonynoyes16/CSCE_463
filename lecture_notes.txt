http request is [/path][?query]
save pointer to fragment, replace # with null terminator
HTTP 1.1 allows caching, chunking, ssl
you can also keep your connection open rather than having it close every time

how to assign an ip to an integer in c++:
char[] ip_arr = [128, 194, 135, 60];
int ip = *(int*)&ip_arr;
or
char a = 128;
char b = 194;
char c = 135;
char d = 60;
int IP = 0;
char* buf = (char*)&IP
sprintf(buf, "%d%d%d%d", a, b, c, d);

well known ports:
- http: 80
- telnet: 23
- ssh: 22
- smth: 25

bind on port 80 in homework
use htons or htonl for homework
check send MSVC

1.1 What is the Internet?
quizzes have problems from the textbook, and tests are a subset of these problems
get 6th edition of textbook
if not on slides, not on test
TCP is connection oriented- always starts with a handshake between client and server
flow control- makes sure that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver so that the receiver's buffer isn't broken
congestion control- senders reduce transmission rate when network is congested

8/31/2023
Transmission delay: Time to send bits is L/R (R = link rate bps, L = packet length in bits)
Propogation delay: d = length of link (m), s = propagation speed in medium (about 2*10^8 m/s), prop dealy = d/s
routers 'store forward', which means they wait to receive a whole packet before sending it out again

quiz next class (entire class), variation of problems 5-33
other questions include programming tutorial from debugging tutorial, c overview, etc. on main page
pay attention to the examples in those files
stack has 1MB buffer size by default
RTT is time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
review slides for quiz

cookie file stored on users host
cookie file sent through http request
server gives out cookie id with set-cookie in http response
caches can allow you to filter urls to prevent undesired webpages
FTP Port is 21
HTTP Port is 80
SMTP is standard for electronic mail, uses port 25
POP3 port 110
IMAP port 143

9/14/2023
UDP port 53
level of DNS Servers: Root -> Top-level domain (.com, .org, etc) -> authoritative (amazon.com, google.com, etc) -> local (user)

Akamai is an example of a CDN with structure similar to typical DNS server
Have a heirarchy of servers that redirect requests to local servers

if 65535 ports is not enough, assign more IPs to the same machine

internet built upon unreliable mechanisms
*** look at rdt2.1 sender, receiver, handles FSM for test
only need two sequence numbers so receiver can check if same packet was transmitted twice (in case of corruption)
sender cant resend packets when they receive an incorrect ack number
if incorrect received, just timeout and send again.

pipelined protocols: send multiple in flight pkts without waiting for acks
*** check todays lecture slide 13 and see how to work through it for test

10/17/2023
*** assume TCP buffers
MSS typically around 1500 bytes
maybe try and derive formula at bottom of slide 8 starting at the top formula

connections get at least 1 CongWin, even if bandwith is already completely used up
*** know differences between congestion control protocols for test 3

upper bound for througput in a network is W/RTT
part 3 of homework doesnt use congestion control, uses flow control

empty = W

producer thread:
empty.wait
mutex.lock
q.push(item)
mutex.unlock
full.release

consumer thread:
full.wait
get pkt & send

get ack Y:
if (y > sendBase):
    empty.release(y-sendBase)

cost for ISP:
delay, link length, congestion

firewall causes traceroute to fail because stopping criterion can be generated by firewall
30 is upper bound when sending burst of packets doing traceroute using icmp

11/14/2023
ISPs typically dont use distance vector
vector only sends out notification when their own node changes
not important to know cost from someone to you
without poisoned reverse, iterations = cost-old cost (slide 8, 50-4)
slide 8, think about a 4 node example where poison reverse isnt enough and count to infinity still occurs
